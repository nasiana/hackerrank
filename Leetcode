Notes:
For my solution, I was able to not have to loop twice as I entered values in the dictionary through a for loop rather than using 
the collections Counter container. Therefore, the order of my Python dictionary will match that of the order of the string, and the 
first occurence will be synonymous with the first occurence in a string.

(In Python 3 onwards, Python dictionaries remember order in which values were added)

However, this isnt the same for the Collections counter container so you have to loop twice.

Approach #1: Prefix Sum [Accepted]
Intuition and Algorithm

We need to quickly compute the sum of values to the left and the right of every index.

Let's say we knew S as the sum of the numbers, and we are at index i. If we knew the sum of numbers leftsum that are to the left of 
index i, then the other sum to the right of the index would just be S - nums[i] - leftsum.

As such, we only need to know about leftsum to check whether an index is a pivot index in constant time. Let's do that: as we iterate
through candidate indexes i, we will maintain the correct value of leftsum.

Algorithm

Although the algorithm is very simple, the iterative approach to constructing Pascal's triangle can be classified as dynamic programming 
because we construct each row based on the previous row.

First, we generate the overall triangle list, which will store each row as a sublist. Then, we check for the special case of 00, as we 
would otherwise return [1][1]. Since numRowsnumRows is always greater than 00, we can initialize triangle with [1][1] as its first row,

Longest Word in Dictionary

Given an array of strings words representing an English Dictionary, return the longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other words in words.

If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return the empty string.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation: The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".

"""
Notes from editorial solution:

Approach #1: Brute Force [Accepted]
Intuition

For each word, check if all prefixes word[:k] are present. We can use a Set structure to check this quickly.

Algorithm

Whenever our found word would be superior, we check if all it's prefixes are present, then replace our answer.

Alternatively, we could have sorted the words beforehand, so that we know the word we are considering would be the answer if all it's 
prefixes are present.
